# klubivr3

KlubiVr3 is a project created when I was attending High-School, in the hopes of managing the newly created Programming club founded by me. This is the 3rd version out of 5 total. The purpose behind this application was the integration and team-work of students passionate about programming in general. The other versions of the app were left in the hands of the generations to come. The main idea about the app was that students had their own platform where they could share their problems, their achievements and have something to be proud of.
